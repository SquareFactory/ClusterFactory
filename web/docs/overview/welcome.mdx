# Welcome to the Cluster Factory CE Documentation

Cluster Factory CE is an open-source k8s-based infrastructure orchestration tool that automates the process of deploying, managing and monitoring workload-optimized clusters from bare metal servers to VMs and containers.

Cluster Factory combines all the standard tools of the last 30 years to be able to manage a cluster in a declarative way in combination with the practice of GitOps.

This allows to be:

- **Highly configurable**: With Helm, all configuration is done in a single `values.yaml` file.
- **Repeatable**: With Argo CD following GitOps practices, all states are specified declaratively and saved in a Git repository.
- **Highly available**: With Kubernetes, container scheduling is automatically ensured and easy to set up.
- **Simple**: A single descriptive YAML per application, with Argo CD to automatically updates the application.
- **Long-term maintainability**: Easy to deploy, update, backup and restore with KOS.

Follow the [next page](./getting-stated/initial-configuration) for creating a full Kubernetes cluster.
