# Welcome to the ClusterFactory CE Documentation

ClusterFactory CE is an open-source Kubernetes-based infrastructure orchestrator that automates the process of deploying, managing and monitoring compute-optimized clusters from bare metal servers to VMs and containers.

ClusterFactory brings together best-in-class solutions from the HPC, Cloud, and DevOps industries to manage a cluster in a declarative way in combination with the GitOps practice.

This allows to be:

- **Performance-oriented**: Integrates a key-in-hand HPC stack including Slurm, MPI, DFS, etc.
- **Highly configurable**: With Helm, all configuration is done in a single `values.yaml` file.
- **Repeatable**: With Argo CD following GitOps practices, all states are specified declaratively and saved in a Git repository.
- **Highly available**: With Kubernetes, container scheduling is automatically ensured and easy to set up.
- **Simple**: A single descriptive YAML per application, with Argo CD to automatically updates the application.
- **Long-term maintainability**: Easy to deploy, update, backup and restore with K0s.

For more information about creating a full Kubernetes cluster, see the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/requirements-recommendations).
