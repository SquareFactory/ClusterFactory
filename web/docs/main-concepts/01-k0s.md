# K0s, the Kubernetes distribution for bare-metal

Further information can be found on their website: [k0sproject.io](https://k0sproject.io).

The reasons we are using k0s instead of kubeadm, k3s, ...:

- It's **light and customizable** via a single YAML file, in a declarative way, therefore we can store the configuration of the whole cluster inside a git repository.
- It allows **HA, multi-node and single node deployment**.
- It runs with a single binary, [k0s](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s).
- It's open-source, including k0sctl. Meaning we could (and probably will) fork k0sctl.
- It's a vanilla Kubernetes meaning it gets updated fast.
- It allows **easy upgrade, backup and restores**.

ClusterFactory aims to be an orchestration tool for many various workloads, including bare-metal and cloud workloads. Maintainability, ease of use, and declarative configuration are the keys to good long-term development. And that's exactly what k0s brings us.
