# Introduction

TODO: Put some kind of logo

Cluster Factory CE is an open-source k8s-based infrastructure orchestration tool that automate the process of deploying, managing and monitoring workload-optimized clusters from bare metal servers to VMs and containers.

Cluster Factory combines all the standard tools of the last 30 years to be able to manage a cluster in a declarative way in combination with the practice of GitOps.

This allows to be:

- **Highly-configurable**: With Helm, all the configuration goes into a single `values.yaml` file.
- **Repeatable**: With ArgoCD following the GitOps practices, all the state are specified declaratively and saved in a Git repository.
- **Highly-available**: With Kubernetes, the scheduling of the containers is automatically assured
- **Simple**: Only one descriptive YAML per application, and argoCD auto-updates the application.
